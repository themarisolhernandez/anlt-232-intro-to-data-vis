    "## What is Shiny?\n",
    "**Shiny for Python** is a modern web application framework developed by [Posit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posit_PBC) (formerly *RStudio*) that allows data scientists and analysts to create rich, interactive web applications using <u>only Python code</u>‚Äîwithout needing to learn HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key features of Shiny for Python\n",
    "- **Reactive programming**: Built-in reactivity eliminates the need for manual callback functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tight integration with Python data tools**: Easily use `pandas`, `plotly`, `matplotlib`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple, readable syntax**: Focus on UI layout and reactive logic without web boilerplate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Browser-based interface**: Apps run in a browser, making deployment easy."

    "## Comparison: Shiny vs Dash\n",
    "Since we explored **[Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)** in earlier modules, it‚Äôs helpful to compare it with **Shiny for Python**, since both are popular frameworks for building web-based data applications in Python. While they share the same end goal‚Äîenabling users to build interactive, data-driven apps‚Äîtheir underlying paradigms and developer experience differ in important ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Shiny for Python | Plotly Dash |\n",
    "|----------|----------|----------|\n",
    "| **Developer** | [Posit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posit_PBC) (formerly *RStudio*) | [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) | \n",
    "| **Programming Model** | Declarative + Reactive | Callback-based (imperative) | \n",
    "| **Ease of Use** | Minimal boilerplate, reactive expressions | More verbose, especially with callbacks | \n",
    "| **UI Layout** | Built-in layout system | Customizable with HTML components | \n",
    "| **Learning Curve** | Lower (especially for R Shiny users) | Moderate | \n",

    "## Anatomy of a Shiny App\n",
    "We'll dive into the anatomy of a Shiny app and look at the basic components. A typical Shiny app in Python has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `ui`: The User Interface\n",
    "The `ui` (User Interface) defines the layout and the elements that are visible to the user. This includes the **inputs** (like sliders, buttons, and dropdowns) and the **outputs** (like plots, tables, or text) that the user interacts with. Essentially, the `ui` is what the user sees and interacts with in the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from shiny import ui\n",
    "\n",
    "app_ui = ui.page_fluid(\n",
    "    ui.input_slider(\"num\", \"Choose a number:\", 1, 100, 50),  # Input: a slider\n",
    "    ui.output_text(\"txt\")  # Output: a text box that will display the result\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of Code\n",
    "- `ui.input_slider(\"num\", \"Choose a number:\", 1, 100, 50)`: Creates a **slider** where the user can choose a number between 1 and 100, starting at 50.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `ui.output_text(\"txt\")`: Defines an area where the **output** (the result of the interaction) will be displayed as text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `server`: The Server Function\n",
    "The `server` function is where the logic and reactivity of the app are defined. It listens to user inputs and generates outputs based on those inputs. Shiny apps are **reactive**, meaning the server automatically updates outputs when inputs change, without requiring the user to refresh the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs how the server function works in our example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from shiny import render\n",
    "\n",
    "def server(input, output, session):\n",
    "    @output\n",
    "    @render.text\n",
    "    def txt():\n",
    "        return f\"You selected: {input.num()}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of Code\n",
    "- `input.num()`: accesses the value selected by the user using the slider (i.e., the number the user chooses).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `@output`: marks the function `txt()` as an output for the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `@render.text`: tells Shiny that the output should be displayed as text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `txt()`: returns the selected number as part of the string, dynamically updating whenever the slider value changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, when the user moves the slider, the text will update to show the selected number, like `\"You selected: 50\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting It All Together\n",
    "In summary, these two components‚Äî`ui` and `server`‚Äîare essential to building Shiny apps. The `ui` defines what the user interacts with, and the `server` defines how the app responds to those interactions. Here is what it looks like all together,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from shiny import App, ui, render\n",
    "\n",
    "app_ui = ui.page_fluid(\n",
    "    ui.input_slider(\"num\", \"Choose a number:\", 1, 100, 50),  # Input: a slider\n",
    "    ui.output_text(\"txt\")  # Output: a text box that will display the result\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "def server(input, output, session):\n",
    "    @output\n",
    "    @render.text\n",
    "    def txt():\n",
    "        return f\"You selected: {input.num()}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "app = App(app_ui, server)\n",
    "```"

    "## Running Shiny Apps\n",
    "To run a Shiny app from the command line, use the `shiny run` command. This command takes a single argument, the path to the app‚Äôs entry point. For example, if your app‚Äôs entry point is `app.py` in the directory `./app_dir`, you can run it like this:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "shiny run --reload --launch-browser app_dir/app.py\n",

    "The `--reload` flag means that file changes in the current directory tree will cause the Python process to restart and the browser to reload. You can also update, save changes to `app.py`, and then wait a moment for the changes to appear in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now have a project that you can run in your terminal üôÇ \n",
    "\n",
    "üí° *Note: This is ideal for local development, rapid prototyping, and eventual deployment.*\n",
    "\n",
